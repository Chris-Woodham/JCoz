# Overview
JCoz is the world's first causal profiler for Java (and eventually all JVM) programs. It was inspired by [coz](https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz), the original causal profiler.

For documentation, including installing, building, and using JCoz, please see our [Wiki page](https://github.com/Decave/JCoz/wiki) page.

## Dependencies

 - [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) (`0.11.0` or higher)
   - `apt-get install libspdlog-dev` for debian/ubuntu
   - `yum install spdlog-devel` for fedora/rhel/centos
 - make
 - jdk, of course

# Getting Started Tutorial

## Build and shakeout

You can drive a basic test use case through the Makefile.

Start by building everything from scratch:
```
$ make clean
$ make all
```

This will build a native agent, which can be found in `build-$BITS` directory.

The `-agentpath` argument has the following format:

```
-agentpath:/path/to/liblagent=progress-point=<progress point class fqn>:<line number>
    _search=<search scope name 1>|<search scope name 2>|...|<scope to ignore N>
    _ignore=<scope to ignore 1>|<scope to ignore 2>|...|<scope to ignore M> 
```

For example, to run profiler on progress point `com.example.MyClass:42`, search scope `java.util` and scopes `java.util.concurrent` and `java.util.stream`, the argument will be

```
-agentpath:/path/to/liblagent=progress-point=com.example.MyClass:42_search=java.util_ignore=java.util.concurrent|java.util.stream
```

If program crashes immediately, make sure the version of jvm which will run your application is the same as the path to `path_to_java/lib` or `path_to_java/lib/server` in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH/DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. It might be that agent is unable to find `libjvm.so`/`libjvm.dylib` library.

## Getting a profiling visualisation

Experiment results will be in file `output.coz`.

Open the [coz UI here](https://plasma-umass.org/coz/), and upload the file and review the output.

## Profiling a real application

You should now be in a position to profile a real application. Use the JCozCLI
and capture some samples!

Be aware for that a real sized application there will be lots of code and lots
of experiments that JCoz needs to run. You should plan to keep JCoz running for
some hours to be confident in the results.
